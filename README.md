# UltrasonicWalker

The Ultrasonic walker device will be a walker mounted sensor system that alerts the user when an obstacle is near by. This will allow the disabled user to safely walk the streets. This will consist of a sweeping HC-SRO4 Ultrasonic sensor connected to a microcontroller, buzzer, and vibrator. In the future this may evolve into a cloud and wifi based system with a gps intergrated into the system.
