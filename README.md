# UltrasonicWalker

The Ultrasonic walker device by Orfeas Magoulas, a middle school student will be a walker mounted sensor system that alerts the user when an obstacle is near by. This will allow the disabled user to safely walk the streets safely whithout a service dog or special expensive equipment. The overall cost should be below $40 to make it accessible to most people. This will consist of a sweeping HC-SRO4 Ultrasonic sensor connected to a microcontroller, buzzer, and vibrator. In the future this may evolve into a cloud and wifi based system with gps location and IoT intergrated into the system.
